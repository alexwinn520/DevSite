			<p>Hi, I'm Alex, a Seattle-based web developer with roots in the creative side of advertising. As a former Art Director, I love to take a clientâ€™s (often vague) direction and create a viable, attractive solution that brings their vision to life. Now as a web developer, I leverage my creativity and problem-solving skills, along with design sense and attention to detail, to create web-based solutions that are practical, user-friendly and easy on the eye.
			<br><br>
			On a more personal note, I enjoy soccer, food, music, hiking / backpacking / canoeing, movies, running, and so on. If you'd like to get in touch, here's my <a ng-href="/#!/contact">contact info</a>.</p>
